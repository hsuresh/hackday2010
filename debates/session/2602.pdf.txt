Theeconomy's capacity tosustain high growthwas under serious threat from thewidespread economic slowdown inthe developed world.It was not clear to us, as also to thepolicy makers in many other countries, howthis crisis would eventually unfold. What would beits impact on the growthmomentum of the Indian economy? How soon will we be able to turnaround thefortunes of our economy? Theshort termglobal outlook was bleak and theconsensus was that year 2009 would face thebrunt of this crisis across the world.At home, there was added uncertaintyon account of the delayed and sub-normalsouth-west monsoon, which had underminedthe kharif crop inthe country. Therewere concerns aboutproduction and prices of food items and its possiblerepercussions on the growthof rural demand.Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weatheredthese crises well. Indian economy now isin a far better position than it was a yearago. That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they werenine months ago whenUPA underthe leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was electedback to power and Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh formed the Governmentfor the second term.The three challenges and the medium termperspective that Ihad outlined in mylast BudgetSpeech remain relevant, eventoday. These would continue to engagethe Indianpolicy-planners for the next few years.The first challenge before us is to quicklyrevert to the high GDP growthpathof 9per cent and then find the means to cross the 'double digit growthbarrier'.Thiscalls for imparting a fresh momentumtothe impressive recovery in growthwitnessed in the past few months. In thisendeavour, I seek Lord Indra's help tomake the recoverymore broad-based in the coming months.", "26.02.20107Growth is only as important as what itenables us to do and be.Therefore,thesecond challenge is to harness economic growth to consolidatethe recent gains inmaking development more inclusive. The thrust imparted to the development ofinfrastructure in rural areas has to bepursued to achieve the desired objectiveswithin a fixed time frame.We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and providehealth facilities at the level of households,both in rural and urban areas. These areissues that require significant resources,and we have to find those resources.The third challenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structuresand institutions at different levels of governance. Indeed, inthe coming years, ifthere is one factor that can hold us backin realising our potential as a modernnation, it is the bottleneck of our publicdelivery mechanisms. There have beenmany initiatives in this regard, in differentsectors, at different points of time.Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works inthose areas. But we have a long way to gobefore we can rest on this count.The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts. It has toreflect the Government'svision and signal the policies to come in future.With development and economicreforms,the focusof economic activity hasshifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the roleof Government as an enabler.An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everythingthat they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise andcreativity can flourish. Government concentrates on supporting and deliveringservices to the disadvantagedsections of the society.It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget thatinforms myspeech today. Iwould now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.Overview of the EconomyYesterday, I laid on the table of theHouse the Economic Survey, which gives adetailed analysis of the economic situation of the countryoverthe past twelvemonths. I intend to highlight onlya few salient features that formthe backdrop ofthis Budget.The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year for the Indian economy. Thesignificant deceleration inthe second halfof 2008-09, brought the real GDPgrowth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over9 per cent in the preceding", "26.02.20108three years. We were among the first fewcountries in the world to implement abroad-based counter-cyclic policy package torespond to the negative fallout of theglobal slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberalmonetary policy support.The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast pacedrecovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 2009-10 itself, when itclocked a GDP growthof 6.1percent, as against 5.8 percent in the fourth quarterof the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, whenthe growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the likelygrowth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in ourpolicy stand.The final figure may well turn out to behigher whenthe thirdand fourth quarterGDP estimates for 2009-10 becomeavailable.This recovery is very encouraging for ithas comeabout despite a negative growthin the agriculture sector. More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentumin the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driverof the economy. The growthrate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5percent\342\200\224 the highest in the past two decades.There arealso signs of a turnaround inthe merchandise exports with a positive growth in Novemberand December 2009after a decline of about twelve successivemonths. Export figures for January arealso encouraging. Significant private investment can now be expected to providethe engine for sustaining a growthof 9per cent per annum. With someluck, Ihope to breach the 10per cent mark in not-too-distant a future.A major concern during the second half of2009-10 has been the emergence ofdouble digit food inflation. Therewas a momentumin food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it wasexpected that the agriculture seasonbeginning June 2009would help inmoderating the food inflation. However,the erratic monsoons and drought likeconditions in large parts ofthe country reinforced thesupply side bottlenecks insome of the essential commodities. This set in motioninflationary expectations.Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices,together with the gradualhardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmittedto other non-food itemsas well. The inflation data for Januaryseems to haveconfirmed this trend.Government is acutely conscious of thissituation and has set in motion steps, inconsultation with the State chief ministers, which should bring down the inflationin the next few monthsand ensure that there is better management of food securityin the country.", "26.02.20109CONSOLIDATING GROWTHManaging a complex economy is a difficulttask, more so whenitis a growingeconomyin a globalised world. And yet, choices have to be madeand they have tobe well-timed.After successfully managing the effects of the global slowdown, we need tostrengthen the domestic macroeconomic environment to help consolidate therebound in growthand sustain it over the mediumterm. We need to review thestimulus imparted to the economyand movetowardsthe preferred path of fiscalconsolidation that facilitated the remarkablegrowth in the pre-crisis five yearperiod. Weneed tomake growth morebroad-based and ensure that supply-demand imbalances are better managed.Fiscal ConsolidationThe success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be tracedto its composition.The approach ofthe Government was to increase thedisposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirecttaxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the MahatmaGandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure.Now that the recoveryhas taken root, thereis a need to review public spending,mobilise resources and gearthem towards buildingthe productivity of theeconomy.In shaping the fiscal policy for 2010-11, I have acted on the recommendations ofthe Thirteenth FinanceCommission. It has recommended a calibrated exit strategyfromthe expansionary fiscal stance of last two years. The Commission hasrecommended a capping of the combineddebtof the Centre and the States at 68per cent of the GDP to be achievedby 2014-15.As a part ofthe fiscal consolidation process, it would befor the first time that theGovernment would target an explicit reduction in its domestic public debt-GDPratio. I intend to bring out, within sixmonths, a status paper giving a detailedanalysis of the situation and a road mapfor curtailing the overall public debt. Thiswould be followed by an annual report on the subject.Tax reformsI amhappy to informthe HonourableMembers that the process for building asimple taxsystem withminimum exemptions and low ratesdesigned to promotevoluntary compliance, is now nearing completion. On the Direct Tax Code thewide-ranging discussions with stakeholdershave been concluded. I am confident", "26.02.201010that the Government will bein a position to implementthe Direct Tax Code fromApril 1, 2011.On Goods and Services Tax, we havebeen focusing on generating a wideconsensus on its design. InNovember,2009 the Empowered Committee of theState Finance Ministers placed the first discussion paper on GST in the publicdomain. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has also made a number ofsignificant recommendations relating to GST,which will contribute to the ongoingdiscussions. We are actively engaged withthe Empowered Committee to finalisethe structure of GST as well as the modalities of its expeditiousimplementation. Itwill be my earnest endeavour to introduce GST along with the DTC in April,2011.People's ownership of PSUsWhile presenting the Budget for 2009-10,I invited people to participate inGovernment'sdisinvestment programme toshare in the wealth and prosperity ofthe Central Public Sector Undertakings.Since then,ownership has been broad based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPCand Rural Electrification Corporation whilethe process is on for National MineralDevelopment Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam. The Government willraise about Rs.25,000 crore during the current year. Through this process, Ipropose to raise a higher amountduring the year 2010-11. The proceeds will beutilised to meet thecapital expenditure requirementsof social sector schemes forcreating new assets.Listing of Central PublicSectorUndertakings improves corporate governance,besides unlocking thevalue for all stakeholders\342\200\224thegovernment, the companyand the shareholders. Market capitalization of five companies which have beenlisted since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times fromthe book value ofRs.78,841 crore to Rs.2,98,929 crore.The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with theGovernment'sobjectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process. This calls forproper targeting of subsidies and expenditure adjustment.Fertiliser subsidyI had announced the intent of the Government for the fertiliser sector in myBudget Speech of 2009. ANutrient Based Subsidy policy for the fertiliser sectorhas since been approved by the Governmentand will become effective from April1, 2010. This policy is expected to promote balanced fertilization through new", "26.02.201011fortified products and focus on extensionservices by the fertiliser industry. Thiswill lead to an increase inagricultural productivity andconsequently better returnsfor the farmers. Over time, the policyis expected to reduce volatility in thedemand for fertiliser subsidy in addition to containing the subsidy bill.Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year2010-11, will remain around MRPs currentlyprevailing. The new system willmove towards direct transfer ofsubsidies to the farmers.Petroleum and Diesel pricing policyIn the last Budget, the constitution of anExpert Group, to advise the Governmenton a viableand sustainable system ofpricing of petroleumproducts, wasannounced. The Group headed by Shri Kirit Parikh hassubmitted itsrecommendations to the Government. Decision on these recommendations will betaken by mycolleague, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in due course.I am very happy to informthe Honourable Members that we have notonlyadhered to the fiscal roadmap that Ihad presented as a part of the Budgetdocuments last year, but we have improved upon it. Except for meeting theliabilities of the year 2008-09, we have not issued oil or fertiliser bonds. I shallcome to the numbers when I refer tothe budget estimates a little later.Improving Investment EnvironmentForeign Direct InvestmentForeign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows during the yearhave been steady in spiteof the decline in global capital flows.India received FDI equity inflows of US$20.9 billion during April-December, 2009 compared to US$ 21.1 billion during thesame period last year.Government has taken a number of steps to simplify the FDI regimeto make iteasily comprehensible to foreign investors. For the first time, both ownership andcontrol have been recognised as central to the FDI policy,and methodology forcalculation of indirect foreign investmentin Indian companies has been clearlydefined. A consistent policy on downstreaminvestmenthas also been formulated.Another major initiative has been the complete liberalization of pricing andpayment oftechnology transfer fee, trademark, brand nameand royalty payments.These payments can now be made under the automatic route.Government also intends to make the FDIpolicy user-friendly byconsolidating allprior regulations and guidelines into one comprehensive document. This wouldenhance clarity and predictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors.", "26.02.201012Financial Stability andDevelopment CouncilThe financial crisis of 2008-09 has fundamentally changedthe structure ofbanking and financialmarkets the worldover. With a view to strengthen andinstitutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, Government hasdecided to setup an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council.Without prejudice to the autonomy of regulators, this Council would monitormacro prudential supervisionof the economy, including the functioning of largefinancial conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. It willalso focus on financial literacyand financial inclusion.Banking LicencesThe Indianbanking systemhas emerged unscathed from the crisis. We need toensure that the banking systemgrows in size and sophistication to meet the needsof a moderneconomy.Besides, there is aneed to extend the geographic coverageof banks and improveaccess to banking services. In this context,I am happy toinform the Honourable Members that the RBI is considering giving someadditional banking licensesto private sector players. Non Banking FinancialCompanies could also be considered, if they meet theRBI's eligibility criteria.Public Sector Bank CapitalisationDuring 2008-09, the Government infused Rs.1900 croreas Tier-I capital in fourpublic sector banks to maintain a comfortable level of Capital to Risk WeightedAsset Ratio. An additional sumof Rs.1200crore is being infused now. For theyear 2010-11, I propose toprovide a sumof Rs.16,500crore to ensure that thePublic Sector Banks are able to attaina minimum 8 per cent Tier-I capital byMarch 31, 2011.Recapitalisation of Regional Rural BanksRegional Rural Banks(RRBs) play an important role in providing credit to ruraleconomy. The capital of thesebanks is shared by the Central Government, sponsorbanks and State Governments. The bankswere last capitalisedin 2006-07. Ipropose to provide further capital to strengthen theRRBs so that they haveadequate capital base to support increased lending to the rural economy.Corporate GovernanceImprovement in corporate governance and regulation is an important part of theoverall investment environment in the country. Government has introduced theCompanies Bill, 2009 in the Parliament, which will replace the existing", "26.02.201013Companies Act, 1956. Theproposed new bill will address issues related toregulation in corporatesector in the context ofthe changing business environment.ExportsGovernment has provided interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment exportcredit up to March 31,2010 for exports incertain sectors. I propose to extend theinterest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports coveringhandicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and mediumenterprises.Special Economic Zones (SEZs)The SEZs have attracted significant flowsof domestic and foreign investments. Infirst three quarters of 2009-10 exports fromSEZs recordeda growthof 127 percent over the corresponding period last year. Government is committed to ensuringcontinued growth of SEZs to drawinvestments and boost exports andemployment.Agriculture GrowthThe agriculture sector occupies centre-stage in our resolve to promote inclusivegrowth, enhance rural incomes and sustainfood security. To spur the growth inthis sector, the Government intends tofollow a four-prongedstrategy covering (a)agricultural production; (b) reduction in wastage of produce; (c) credit support tofarmers; and (d) a thrust to the food processing sector.The first element of the strategy is toextend the green revolution to the easternregion of the country comprising Bihar,Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, WestBengal and Orissa, with the active involvement of GramSabhas and the farmingfamilies. For the year2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.400crore for thisinitiative.In the 60th year of the Republic, it is proposed to organise 60,000 \"pulses and oilseed villages\" in rain-fed areas during 2010-11 andprovide an integratedintervention for water harvesting, watershed management and soil health, toenhance the productivity of the dry landfarming areas. I propose to provideRs.300 crore for this purpose. This initiative will be anintegral part of theRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.The gains already made in the green revolution areas have to be sustained throughconservation farming, which involves concurrent attention to soil health, waterconservation and preservation ofbiodiversity. I propose an allocation of Rs.200crore for launching this climateresilient agriculture initiative.", "26.02.201014Thesecond elementof the strategy relates to reduction of significant wastages instorage as well as in the operations ofthe existing food supply chains in thecountry. This needs to be addressed. Asthe Prime Minister has saidrecently, \"Weneed greater competition and therefore need to take a firmview on opening up ofthe retail trade.\" It will helpin bringing down the considerable difference betweenthe farm gate prices, wholesale prices and retail prices.There is wastage of grain procured for buffer stocks and publicdistribution systemdue to acuteshortage of storage capacityin the Food Corporation of India.

I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on paymentsmade to National Laboratories, researchassociations, colleges, universitiesandother institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.", "26.02.201029Currently, any payment made to an approved scientific research association iseligible for weighted deduction. The income of the approved scientific researchassociation is exempt fromtax. I propose that payments made to approvedassociations engaged in research in socialsciences or statisticalresearch would beallowed a weighted deduction of 125 per cent. The income of such approvedresearch associations shall be exempt fromtax.InmyBudgetSpeech last year, I stated that profit linked deductions areinherentlyinefficient and liable to misuse. To incentivise businesses in prioritysectors, I introducedinvestment linked deduction as analternative to profit linkeddeduction. To give a boost to investmentin the tourismsector which has highemployment potential, I proposeto extend the benefit of investment linkeddeduction under the Act to new hotels of two-star category and above anywhereinIndia.To provide one time interimrelief to the housing and real estate sector which wasimpacted by the global recession, I propose to allow pending projects to becompleted within a period of five years instead offour years for claiming adeduction on their profits. I also proposeto relax the norms for built-up area ofshops and other commercial establishmentsin housing projectsto enable basicfacilities for their residents.All businesses with a turnover exceeding Rs.40 lakh are currently required tohave their accounts audited. A similar provision also applies to all professionswhose receipts exceed Rs.10 lakh. I, as Finance Minister, had introduced theselimits in my budget of 1984. It ishigh time to reduce the compliance burden onsmall taxpayers. I, therefore, propose to enhance these limits toRs.60 lakh in thecase of businesses and Rs.15 lakhin the case of professions.To facilitate the business operations ofsmall taxpayers, I had extended the scopeof presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs.40 lakh.To further reduce the compliance burdenon small taxpayers, I now propose toenhance this limit to Rs.60 lakh.The threshold limits ofpayments below which tax is notdeductible at source haveremained unchanged for a long time. I propose to rationalise these thresholds.Relaxing the currentprovisionson disallowance of expenditure, I proposetoallow deduction of such expenditure, iftax has been deducted at any time duringthe financial year and paid before the duedate of filing the return. This will allowmost deductors additional time up to September of the next financial year. At thesame time, I propose to increase the interest charged ontax deducted but notdeposited by the specified date, from12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum.", "26.02.201030Last year, I had provided forthe taxation of the newly introduced LimitedLiability Partnership (LLP) on the same linesas exists for a general partnershipfirm. To facilitate the conversion of smallcompanies into LLPs,I propose that thiswill not be subject to capital gains tax.Under the current provisions of the Act,\"the advancement ofany other object ofgeneral public utility\" cannot be consideredas \"charitable purpose\" if it involvescarrying on of any activity in the natureof trade, commerce or business. I havereceived representations frommany organisations seeking somerelaxation inthisrestriction. I propose that this restriction would not be applicable if the receiptsfrom such activities do not exceed Rs.10 lakh in the year.My proposals on direct taxation are estimated to result in a revenue loss ofRs.26,000 crore for the year.Indirect TaxesNow I turn to Indirect Taxes.The major objectives that have guided mein the formulation of myproposals onindirect taxes are the need to achieve somedegree of fiscal consolidation withoutimpairing the recoveryprocess and moving forward on the road toGST.Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptomsof economic recovery aremore widespread and clear-cut now. The three fiscal stimuluspackages that theGovernment introducedin quick successionhave helped the process of recoverysignificantly. The improvement inour economic performance encourages a courseof fiscal correction even as the globalsituation warrants caution. Therefore,Ipropose to partially roll back the ratereduction in Central Excise duties andenhance the standard rate on all non-petroleumproducts from8 per cent to 10 percent and valorem. The specific rates ofduty applicable to portland cement andcement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately.Similarly, the advalorem component ofexcise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles whichwas reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is beingincreased by 2 percentagepoints to 22 per cent.In the wake of spiralling petroleumprices, Government providedfull exemptionfrombasic customs duty to crude petroleumand proportionately reducedthe basicduty on refined petroleum products in June, 2008.Compared to the internationalprice of the Indian crude basket of US$ 112per barrel at that time, the prices aremuch softer at present. Inview of the pressing need tomove back to a fiscalconsolidation path, I propose to restorethe basic duty of 5 percent on crudepetroleum;7.5 per cent ondiesel and petrol and 10per cent on other refined", "26.02.201031products. I also propose to enhance the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel byRe.1 per litre each.g\303\211\303\211\303\222 \302\266\303\211\302\256n \302\252\303\211\303\211n\302\264\303\211 (\303\240\303\211v\303\211\303\244{\303\211\r\303\226\302\256\303\211):\303\240\303\211c\303\211\303\244n\302\252\303\211\303\211, B\303\211E\303\243\303\211 c\303\211\303\222 \303\240\303\211c\303\206M\303\211\303\211<\303\207 {\303\211\302\256S\303\211S\303\211\303\211\303\207 c\303\226<\303\207 c\303\250 +\303\211\303\211\303\250\302\256 +\303\211\303\211V\303\211 c\303\211\303\222 \303\240\303\211c\303\206M\303\211\303\211<\303\207 \302\244\303\211f\303\203\303\211 n\303\211\303\222 ...(B\302\252\303\211\302\264\303\211v\303\211\303\211x\303\211)SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE;Since Iquit smoking many years ago, I wouldurge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious tohealth.

Thisexemption is to lapse in July 2010. Themodernization of this labour-intensive sector is yet to reach the expected level. Ipropose therefore, to extendit up to March 31, 2011 along with a CVD exemption.", "26.02.201034I hope thiswill provide sufficient time for the sector to achieve the desiredobjective.One of the prerequisites for agriculturalproductivity is access to good quality anddisease-resistant seeds. I propose to exempt the testing and certification ofagricultural seeds from service tax.I also propose to exempt the transportation by road of cereals and pulses fromservice tax. Their transportation by rail would remain exempt.I propose two measures under the Central Excise law to ease the cash flowposition for small-scale manufacturers hardhit by the economic slowdown. First,they would be permitted to take full credit of Central Exciseduty paid on capitalgoods in a single instalment in the year oftheir receipt. Secondly,they would bepermitted to pay Central Excise duty on a quarterly,rather than monthly basis.These measures that come into effecton the April 1, 2010should provide themconsiderable relief.EnvironmentHarnessing renewable energy sources toreduce dependence on fossil fuels is nowrecognised as a credible strategyfor combating global warming and climatechange. To buildthe corpus of the National Clean Energy Fund announced earlier,I propose to levy a clean energy cess on coalproduced inIndia at anominal rate ofRs.50 per tonne. This cess willalso apply to imported coal.In pursuance of Government'sresolve to implement the National Solar Mission, Ipropose to provide aconcessional customs duty of 5 per centto machinery,instruments, equipment andappliances etc. required for the initial setting up ofphotovoltaic and solar thermal power generating units.I also propose toexemptthemfromCentral Excise duty. Similarly,ground source heatpumps used to tapgeo-thermal energy would be exemptfrombasic customs duty and specialadditional duty.Wind energy has shown promising growthinthe country in recent years. As ameasure of further relief, I propose to exempt a few more specified inputs requiredfor the manufacture of rotor blades for wind energy generatorsfrom CentralExcise duty.LED lights are staging a debut as a highly energy-efficient source of lighting forstreets, homes and offices. Central Excise duty onthese is being reducedfrom8per cent to 4 per cent atpar with Compact Fluorescent Lamps.", "26.02.201035Full exemption fromCentral Excise dutywas provided to electric cars andvehicles that offer an eco-friendly alternative to petrol or diesel vehicles. Themanufacturers of such vehicles have expressed difficulty in neutralising the dutypaid on their inputs and components. Ipropose to remedy this by imposing anominal duty of 4 per cent on suchvehicles.I also propose to exempt somecriticalparts or sub-assemblies of such vehicles frombasic customs duty and specialadditional duty subject to actual user condition. Theseparts would also enjoy aconcessional CVD of 4 per cent.The humble cycle rickshaw is now being acclaimed as an environment-friendlymeans of transport. CSIR has developedan innovative product called 'soleckshaw'to replace manually-operated rickshaws. Itruns on batteries which are charged bysolar power. I propose to provide a concessional excise duty of 4 per cent to thisproduct. Its key parts and components arealso being exempted fromcustoms duty.To encourage the use of bio-degradable materials, I propose to exempt the importof compostable polymer frombasic customs duty.InfrastructureStrengthening the public transport systemis another means of reducingdependenceon fossil fuels. I propose togrant project import status to 'Monorailprojects for urban transport'at a concessional basic duty of 5 per cent.Full exemption from import duty is available to specified machinery for roadconstruction projects on the condition thatthe machinery shall not be soldordisposed offor a minimumperiod of fiveyears. In view of representations thatthis leads to idling of machinery, I propose to allow resale of such machinery onpayment ofimport duty at depreciated value. It is also being clarified that theimporter is free to relocate such machinery to other eligible road constructionprojects.With the subscriber base growing at 14million per month, India is one of thefastest growing markets for mobile phoneconnections in the world. Domesticproduction of mobile phones is now picking up inview of exemptions frombasic,CVD and special additional duties granted to their parts, components andaccessories. To encourage the domesticmanufacture of accessories, theseexemptionsare now being extended toparts of battery chargers and hands-freeheadphones. Also, the validityofthe exemption fromspecial additional duty isbeing extended till March 31, 2011.", "26.02.201036Medical SectorMedical equipment, instruments and appliances are subjected to a very compleximport duty regimebased on several long lists that describe individual items.Multiple rates coupledwith descriptionsnot aligned with tariff lines, result indisputes and at times prevent state-of-art equipment fromgetting the benefit ofexemption.I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent,CVD of 4 per cent with fullexemption from special additional duty on all medicalequipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on partsand accessories for the manufacture ofsuch equipment while they would beexempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently availableto medical equipmentand devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc.is being retained. The concession available to Government hospitals or hospitalsset up under a statute is also being retained.The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputsattractahigher rate of duty than thefinished product. Ipropose to exemptspecified inputs for themanufacture of such implants fromimport duty.InfotainmentIndia is a nation ofmovie-goers. Thefilmindustry has been experiencingdifficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distributionloaded on electronic medium vis-a-visthose imported on cinematographic film,owing toadifferential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise thisbycharging customs duty only on the valueof the carrier medium. The samedispensation would apply to music and gaming softwareimported for duplication.In keeping with the traditionof Indian cinema, however, I shall provide a surpriseending. In all such cases the value representing the transfer of intellectual rightswould be subjected to service tax.Cable transmission of infotainment isundergoing a transformation withtheadoption of digital technology. The multi-service operators need to invest in\"Digital Head End\" equipment.To enable this, I proposeto provide project importstatus at a concessional customs dutyof 5 per centwith full exemption fromspecial additional duty to the initial setting up of such projects.Precious MetalsThe prices of preciousmetals continue torise. Since the customs duty is levied onthese at specific rates, I proposeto index the rates as follows:\342\200\242On gold and platinumfromRs.200 per10 grams to Rs.300 per 10 grams.", "26.02.201037\342\200\242 On silver from Rs.1,000per kg to Rs.1,500 per kg.Gems and jewellery is a traditional itemin our export basket. Rhodium- aprecious metal used for polishing jewelleryattracts a basic customs duty of 10 percent. This is being reduced to 2 per cent.To encourage domestic refining capacityfor gold, I propose to reduce the basiccustoms duty on goldore and concentrates from2 per cent ad valoremto aspecific duty of Rs.140 per 10 grams ofgold content withfull exemption fromspecial additional duty. Further, the exciseduty on refined gold made fromsuchore or concentrate is beingreduced from 8 per cent to aspecific duty of Rs.280 per10 grams.Other ProposalsFull exemption from import dutyis available to specified inputs or raw materialsrequired for the manufacture of sports goods which are assuming importance as anitemof export. This is being expanded to cover a few more items.In order to incentivise the domestic production of microwave ovens, I propose toreduce the basic customs duty on one ofits key components, namely magnetronsfrom 10 per cent to 5 per cent.Presently, there is a value limit of Rs.1lakh per annumon duty-free import ofcommercial samples as personal baggage. Ipropose to enhance this limit to Rs.3lakh per annum.Industry has represented that the exemption from special additional duty of 4 percent based on refunds leads to substantial blockage of funds.To ease thisdifficulty, I propose to provide an outright exemption from special additional dutyto goods imported in a pre-packaged formfor retail sale. This would also covermobile phones, watches and ready-madegarments even when they are notimported in pre-packaged form. The refund-based exemption is also being retainedfor cases not covered bythe new dispensation.Toy balloons are a source of joy to millionsof children. To bring a smile to theirmothers'faces, I propose to fully exempt themfromCentral Excise duty.Someof the other relief measuresthat I propose are as under:\342\200\242Reduction in basic customs duty on longpepper from70 per cent to 30 per cent;\342\200\242Reduction in basic customs duty on asafoetida from30 per cent to 20 per cent;", "26.02.201038\342\200\242Reduction in central excise duty on replaceable kits for household type waterfilters other than those based onRO technology to 4 per cent;\342\200\242 Reduction in central excise duty on corrugated boxes and cartons from8 per centto 4 per cent;\342\200\242 Reduction in central excise duty on latex rubber thread from8 per cent to 4 percent; and\342\200\242Reduction in excise duty on goods covered underthe Medicinal and ToiletPreparations Act from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.My proposals relating to customs and central excise are estimated to result in a netrevenue gainof Rs.43,500 crore for the year.Service TaxThe service sector contributes nearly 60per cent of the GDP. The service tax toGDP ratio however, isonly around 1 percent. This sector thus, has significantpotential to augment revenue.To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to12 per cent asit was before I introduced the third stimuluspackage. I am not resorting to thisoption tomaintain the growth momentumand also tobring about a convergence inthe rates of tax on goods and services. I, therefore, propose to retain the rate oftaxon services at 10 per cent to pave the way forward for GST.I had another option \342\200\223 to bring all services under service tax. I amnot opting forthis either at this stage. I propose, however, to bring certainservices, hithertountaxed, within the purview of the service tax levy. Theseare being notifiedseparately.I am also proposing certain legislativechanges to plug revenue leakages, toremove distortions and to clarify certain doubts that have arisen over a period oftime. I do not want to waste the precious time of the House elaborating the details,as they are available in the Finance Bill and other Budget documents.Export of services, especially in the area of Information Technology and BusinessProcess Outsourcing,generates substantial employment and brings in foreignexchange.

Thedelegation of Pakistan was led by theForeign Secretary of Pakistan, Mr. Salman Bashir.The invitation to the Pakistan Foreign Secretary should be seen in thecontext ofGovernment'sdesire to ensure communication between the twocountries, to address the core concernsrelating to terrorismdirected againstusfromPakistan, and pending humanitarian issues.I wish to informthis august House thatthe two sides held a frank,constructive and useful meeting.
